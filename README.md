- VC dimension and structural risk minimization
### 2. Support Vector Machines
- The Support Vector Machine approach
- Detailed derivation of SVM
- SVC (Support Vector Classification)
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)
- SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) and variants
- Optimization procedures
### 3. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
- Overview of RKHS
- Positive definite kernels
- Main theorems and the kernel trick
- Kernel-based learning machines
- Some basic kernels and their properties
- Kernel development and special kernel classes
### 4. Gaussian Process Networks
